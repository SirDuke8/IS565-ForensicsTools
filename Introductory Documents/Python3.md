**What is Python 3?**
Python 3 is like a versatile and friendly programming language that allows you to write instructions for a computer to perform tasks. It's a bit like giving your computer a set of detailed and easy-to-understand recipes to follow. Python 3 is especially popular because it's easy to learn and can be used for a wide range of applications.

**Basic Python 3 Concepts and Commands:**

1. **Print to the Screen:**
   Python 3 allows you to display information on the screen using the `print()` function. For example:

   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```

   This code will print "Hello, world!" to the screen.

2. **Variables:**
   You can use variables to store and manipulate data in Python. For instance:

   ```python
   name = "Alice"
   age = 18
   ```

   Here, `name` and `age` are Python variables.

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   Python supports conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` for making decisions in your code. For example:

   ```python
   age = 18
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are an adult.")
   else:
       print("You are a minor.")
   ```

   This code checks if a person is an adult based on their age.

4. **Loops:**
   Python provides loops like `for` and `while` to repeat tasks. Here's an example of a `for` loop:

   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       print(f"Iteration {i}")
   ```

   This code repeats a statement five times.

5. **Functions:**
   Python allows you to define and use functions to organize and reuse code. For example:

   ```python
   def greet(name):
       print(f"Hello, {name}!")

   greet("Bob")
   ```

   This code defines a function `greet` and uses it to greet a person named Bob.

6. **Lists:**
   Python has data structures like lists to store collections of items. For example:

   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   ```

   Here, `fruits` is a Python list.

7. **Input from Users:**
   You can get input from users with the `input()` function:

   ```python
   name = input("What's your name? ")
   print(f"Hello, {name}!")
   ```

   This code prompts the user for their name and greets them.

Python 3 is an excellent programming language for beginners, and it's widely used in various fields, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and more. Learning Python 3 can open up a world of opportunities for programming and problem-solving.
