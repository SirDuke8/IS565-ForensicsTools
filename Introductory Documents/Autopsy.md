**What is Autopsy?**
Autopsy is a graphical user interface (GUI) for digital forensics, doesn't primarily involve direct command-line usage like some other tools in Kali Linux. Instead, it provides a point-and-click interface for conducting forensic analysis.

**Basic Autopsy Features:**

1. **Create a New Case:**
   Open Autopsy and create a new case to organize your investigation.

2. **Add Data Source:**
   Add the disk image or file system you want to analyze as a data source.

3. **Keyword Search:**
   Use the search functionality to look for specific keywords or phrases within the analyzed data.

4. **Timeline Analysis:**
   Navigate to the timeline view to see a chronological representation of file activities.
   
5. **File Analysis:**
   Examine files individually for details such as metadata, content, and associated information.

6. **Hash Analysis:**
   Calculate hash values for files and compare them to known values to verify integrity.

7. **Tagging and Bookmarking:**
   Tag and bookmark items of interest to make them easily accessible during the investigation.

8. **Reporting:**
   Generate reports summarizing your findings for documentation and legal purposes.

9. **Exporting Data::**
   Export relevant data for use in other tools or for sharing with colleagues.

10. **Data Carving:**
   Autopsy supports data carving, allowing you to recover files from unallocated space on the disk.


Autopsy is designed to be user-friendly, and much of its functionality is accessible through the GUI.

If you're looking for command-line tools that Autopsy uses under the hood (which are part of The Sleuth Kit), you might want to explore commands like 

```
mmls
fsstat
fls
icat
```

These commands are used for low-level forensic analysis tasks and are typically run in a terminal. For specific details on commands and features, it's recommended to refer to the official Autopsy documentation or guides provided by the digital forensics community.
