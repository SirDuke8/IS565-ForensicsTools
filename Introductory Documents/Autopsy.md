**What is Autopsy?**
Autopsy is a graphical user interface (GUI) for digital forensics, doesn't primarily involve direct command-line usage like some other tools in Kali Linux. Instead, it provides a point-and-click interface for conducting forensic analysis.

**Basic Autopsy Features:**

1. **Create a New Case:**
   Open Autopsy and create a new case to organize your investigation.

2. **Add Data Source:**
   Add the disk image or file system you want to analyze as a data source.

3. **Keyword Search:**
   Use the search functionality to look for specific keywords or phrases within the analyzed data.

4. **Timeline Analysis:**
   Navigate to the timeline view to see a chronological representation of file activities.
   
5. **File Analysis:**
   Examine files individually for details such as metadata, content, and associated information.

6. **Hash Analysis:**
   Calculate hash values for files and compare them to known values to verify integrity.

7. **Tagging and Bookmarking:**
   Tag and bookmark items of interest to make them easily accessible during the investigation.

8. **Reporting:**
   Generate reports summarizing your findings for documentation and legal purposes.

9. **Exporting Data::**
   Export relevant data for use in other tools or for sharing with colleagues.

10. **Data Carving:**
   Autopsy supports data carving, allowing you to recover files from unallocated space on the disk.


Autopsy is designed to be user-friendly, and much of its functionality is accessible through the GUI.

If you're looking for command-line tools that Autopsy uses under the hood (which are part of The Sleuth Kit), you might want to explore following commands:  

1. mmls (Media Management List Structure):

```
mmls disk_image.dd
```

mmls is used to display the layout of partitions within a disk image. It provides information about the start and end sectors, size, and file system type of each partition.

2. fsstat (File System Statistics):

```
fsstat -f ntfs disk_image.dd
```

fsstat is used to display information about the file system within a partition. It provides details such as the file system type, block size, and various statistics about the file system.

3. fls (File List):

```
fls -r -f ext4 disk_image.dd
```

fls is used to list file and directory names in a file system or a specific directory. It can be used to examine the contents of a file system and gather information about files, including their metadata (such as timestamps and file sizes).   

4. icat (Index Catalog):

```
icat -f ext3 disk_image.dd 1234
```

icat is used to output the contents of a file given its inode number. Inodes are data structures that store information about files in Unix-like file systems. icat allows forensic analysts to extract the contents of a specific file, which can be crucial for examining the actual data stored on a disk image. In this example, replace "1234" with the actual inode number of the file you want to extract.

These commands are used for low-level forensic analysis tasks and are typically run in a terminal. And these are often used in combination to conduct a thorough analysis of disk images and file systems during digital forensic investigations.
