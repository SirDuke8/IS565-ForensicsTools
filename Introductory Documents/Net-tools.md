**What is net-tools?**
Net-tools is like a toolbox for managing and troubleshooting computer networks. It offers a set of simple, text-based commands that help you inspect, configure, and troubleshoot various aspects of network connectivity on a computer.

**Basic net-tools Commands:**

1. **Display Network Interfaces:**
   To view the network interfaces (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi) on your computer, you can use the `ifconfig` command:

   ```
   ifconfig
   ```

   This command provides information about each network interface, including its IP address, MAC address, and more.

2. **View Routing Table:**
   The `route` command displays your computer's routing table, which is essential for determining how network traffic is directed:

   ```
   route -n
   ```

   This command shows the routing table in numeric format.

3. **Ping a Host:**
   You can use the `ping` command to test network connectivity with a remote host:

   ```
   ping google.com
   ```

   This command sends packets to "google.com" and measures the response time, helping you check if you can reach a remote server.

4. **Check DNS Resolution:**
   To verify if your DNS (Domain Name System) is working correctly, you can use the `nslookup` command:

   ```
   nslookup google.com
   ```

   This command queries a DNS server to resolve a domain name to an IP address.

5. **Scan Open Ports:**
   The `netstat` command allows you to view open network connections and listening ports:

   ```
   netstat -tuln
   ```

   This command lists active network connections and open ports on your computer.

6. **Trace Route to a Host:**
   You can trace the route to a remote host using the `traceroute` command:

   ```
   traceroute google.com
   ```

   This command shows you the path that network packets take to reach the destination host.

7. **List Network Connections:**
   The `ss` command is a more modern alternative to `netstat` and displays information about socket connections:

   ```
   ss -tuln
   ```

   This command shows a list of network connections and listening ports.

Net-tools utilities are handy for troubleshooting and managing network-related tasks on a Linux or Unix system. They provide valuable insights into network configuration, connectivity, and performance. It's a good skill to have, especially for those interested in computer networking or system administration.
