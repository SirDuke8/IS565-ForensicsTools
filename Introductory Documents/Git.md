**What is Git?**
Git is like a time machine for your code. It allows you to take snapshots of your project at different points in time, making it easy to go back to a previous version of your code if something goes wrong. It's used by programmers to work together on software projects, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

**Basic Git Commands:**
Here are some basic Git commands that high school students might find useful:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   To start using Git in a project, you need to initialize a Git repository. You do this in your project's directory:

   ```
   git init
   ```

   This command sets up Git to start tracking changes in your project.

2. **Clone a Repository:**
   To get a copy of a project from a remote Git repository (like one on GitHub), you use the `git clone` command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

   This command downloads a copy of the project to your local machine.

3. **Check Status:**
   To see which files have been changed and need to be committed, use:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   This command tells you what's going on in your project.

4. **Stage Changes:**
   Before you save changes, you need to stage them. You do this with the `git add` command:

   ```
   git add filename
   ```

   This command tells Git which changes to include in the next snapshot.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   After staging your changes, you make a snapshot with the `git commit` command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

   This command saves your changes with a brief message describing what you did.

6. **Push Changes:**
   If you're working with others and want to share your changes, you use the `git push` command:

   ```
   git push
   ```

   This command sends your changes to a remote repository (like on GitHub).

7. **Pull Changes:**
   To get the latest changes from a remote repository, you use the `git pull` command:

   ```
   git pull
   ```

   This command brings in changes made by others.

8. **View Commit History:**
   You can see the history of changes with the `git log` command:

   ```
   git log
   ```

   This command shows you a list of commits, who made them, and when.

Git is a powerful tool for software development, allowing you to work on projects efficiently and collaborate with others. Learning Git is an important skill for anyone interested in coding or software development.
