**What is Nikto?**
Nikto is like a security detective for websites. It scans websites and web servers to find security issues and vulnerabilities. Think of it as a tool that helps keep websites safe from potential threats.

**Basic Nikto Commands:**

1. **Scan a Website:**
   To scan a website for security vulnerabilities, you can use the `nikto` command, followed by the target website's URL:

   ```
   nikto -h https://www.example.com
   ```

   This command tells Nikto to scan the specified website for potential security issues.

2. **Save the Scan Results:**
   You can save the results of a Nikto scan to a file for later review. To do this, you can use the `-o` flag:

   ```
   nikto -h https://www.example.com -o scan_results.txt
   ```

   This command saves the scan results to a file named "scan_results.txt."

3. **Customize Scan Parameters:**
   Nikto allows you to customize your scan by specifying various parameters and plugins. For example, to enable a specific plugin and set the scan speed:

   ```
   nikto -h https://www.example.com -Tuning 0x0000041
   ```

   This command sets the scan speed and enables specific plugins.

4. **Scan Multiple Targets:**
   You can scan multiple websites or web servers simultaneously by providing a file containing a list of target URLs:

   ```
   nikto -E -h target_list.txt
   ```

   This command scans the targets listed in the "target_list.txt" file.

5. **Update Nikto's Database:**
   Nikto's vulnerability database is regularly updated. To ensure you have the latest information, you can update the database using:

   ```
   nikto -update
   ```

   This command updates Nikto's vulnerability database.

6. **View Help and Usage Information:**
   To get more details about Nikto's options and usage, you can use the `-Help` flag:

   ```
   nikto -Help
   ```

   This command provides a list of available options and how to use them.

Nikto is an important tool for checking the security of websites and web servers. It helps find and fix potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Understanding how to use Nikto is crucial for anyone interested in web security and cybersecurity.
