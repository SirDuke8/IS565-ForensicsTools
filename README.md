## Proof-of-Value



This project is set to be improved upon in the future. We can change the instance type to allow for interaction with tools like Wireshark and enhance the security group and VPC it is attached to. With different instance types and configurations, we can introduce additional technologies to the instance. We are excited to work more on this project in the coming months!
