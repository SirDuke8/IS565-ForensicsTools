Proof-of-value 


This project is set to be improved upon in the future, we can change the instance type to allow for interaction with things such as wireshark, and we can lock down the instance more by improving the security group and VPC it is attached to. With other instance types and configurations, we can start to add more technologies to the instance. We are excited to work more on this project in the coming months!
